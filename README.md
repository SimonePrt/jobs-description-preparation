This work was part of a project carried out during the academic year at the University of Pisa.
The goal of this phase was to analyze how job descriptions are written. After cleaning the data, I applied clustering techniques to group similar job descriptions together.

Initially, I expected each cluster to contain job descriptions related to the same or similar job titles. However, the results showed that some clusters included a mix of very different job titles. This suggested that employers do not always accurately associate job descriptions with the appropriate job titles.

Following this, I extracted both soft and hard skills from the descriptions in order to compare the profiles across different clusters.
